## What is it?

Books4Bem is an app that I created for my girlfriend. She wanted me to code something that would randomly select an unread book for her to read (from her vast collection of books). Instead of just creating a random book picker (too simple), I decided to re-create an old project. This project is a complete overhaul, it saves your books to a database, so you can access them from any device, and this project also looks a lot nicer than my old one.
